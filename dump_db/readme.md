# dump_db
Want a very easy way to take a dump of your Joomla's database ? Don't want to enter to your admin or hosting cpanel ?  Perhaps you don't have such access (just FTP and nothing else).

Put dumb_db.php in the same folder of the Joomla's configuration.php file and run it from your preferred browser (which, for sure, can't be Internet Explorer because you're a very smart guy)

## Use it
Just copy the dump_db.php script in the root folder of your Joomla website.  Use your FTP client to do this.

## Run it
Start a browser and run the file i.e go to f.i. http://site/dump_db.php.   A form will be displayed, just click on the button.

After a few seconds, a zip file will be download, it's the copy of your database.

## Remark
Don't forget to remove the script once you've finished with it.
