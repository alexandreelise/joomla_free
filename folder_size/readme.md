Do you know the size of your website ?  How many megabytes/gigabytes ? 
Do you know how many disk space take all your .zip files ? your images ? 
Which folder is the biggest one ? 

All these questions and more will find an answer with the `folder_size.php` script.  

## Use it ##

Just copy the folder_size.php script in the folder you want to analyze (the root folder f.i.).  Use your FTP client to do this.

## Run it ##

Start a browser and run the file i.e go to f.i. http://site/folder_size.php.

The script will start immediatly, there is nothing to do except wait until the results are displayed.

## Remark ##

Don't forget to remove the script once you've finished with it.
