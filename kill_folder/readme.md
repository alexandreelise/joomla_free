# kill_folder

When you need to kill a full folder structure by using a FTP client you know that it's slow, really slow and by slow, I mean awfully slow.

The kill_folder.php script is the one I use when I need to work on an hacked site and when my client allow me to, f.i., kill an old website.

## BE CAREFULL !!!
This script is dangerous.  Use it under your own responsability.  The aim of the script is to kill files and folders i.e. not to take an archive, move files to another location, ... just kill them.    

## Use it
Just copy the kill_folder.php script in the folder you want to remove.  So, if you want to kill the /www_root/old_site folder (and subfolders), use your FTP client and put kill_folder.php into the old_site root.

## Run it
Start a browser and run the file i.e go to f.i. http://your_old_site/kill_folder.php.

Click on the Clean button, wait a few seconds and when it's done, click on the "Kill this script" button so the kill_file.php script will be removed from your website.

## Remark
The database is not impacted in case of a CMS i.e. the old database stay in place.
