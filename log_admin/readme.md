# log_admin #

When you don't remember again your super admin account or even password, log_admin will allow you to start your administrator interface by, just, putting this script in your admin folder. 

Don't be blocked anymore or don't play anymore with phpMyAdmin for creating a new admin / resetting the password / ..., just use this straigth-forward script

## BE CAREFULL !!! ##

**If you've copy this script onto your website, don't forget it ! The script will be automatically deleted after the first use but ... use it ;-)  If the script stay unused, don't forget to delete it.**

## Use it ##

Just copy the `log_admin.php` script in your `/administrator` folder of Joomla.

## Run it ##

Start a browser and run the script by going to `http://yourwebsite/administrator/log_admin.php`.

The script will retrieve the first non blocked super-admin, start a session with that user, open your Joomla backend interface and make a suicide : the script will be removed automatically
