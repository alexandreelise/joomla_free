# Some scripts to simplify your tasks Joomla #

In this repository, you'll find a few scripts that I've written for my own use.  Perhaps one of these scripts will be usefull for you too.

## folder_size ##

> Do you know the size of your website ?  How many megabytes/gigabytes ? 

Searching for a tool that will display the disk size taken by your website and display the results : 

1. By folder (*which ones is the biggest consumer ?*)
2. By file's extensions (*what's the size of all pdfs, images, ...? ?*)

All these questions and more will find an answer with the `folder_size.php` script.

## kill_folder ##

> TLDR; Very fast way to remove every files in a folder (subfolders included)

`kill_folder.php` will allow to quickly remove a folder structure i.e. including subfolders by running the script from an URL.  This way is MUCH faster than killing a folder from a FTP client which is awfully slow.

## show_table ##

> TLDR; Extract informations from your Joomla database and display them in a raw table; allowing to quickly connect that table into a spreadsheet program (like MS Excel)

`show_table.php` allows you to extract informations from your Joomla database : run a SQL query and export it as a table.  Nice HTML output with Bootstrap and jQuery or a RAW output to only output a `<table>` tag so the generated table can be easily reuse in, for instance, a spreadsheet program.
