# Some scripts to simplify your tasks Joomla

In this repository, you'll find a few scripts that I've written for my own use.  Perhaps one of these scripts will be usefull for you too.

## folder_size 

Do you know the size of your website ?  How many megabytes/gigabytes ? Do you know how many disk space take all your .zip files ?  your images ? 
Which folder is the biggest one ? All these questions and more will find an answer with the folder_size.php script

## kill_folder

kill_folder.php will allow to quickly remove a folder structure i.e. including subfolders by running the script from an URL.  This way is MUCH faster than killing a folder from a FTP client which is awfully slow.

## show_table

show_table.php allows you to extract informations from your Joomla database : run a SQL query and export it as a table.  Nice HTML output with Bootstrap and jQuery or a RAW output to only output a &lt;table&gt; tag so the generated table can be easily reuse in, for instance, a spreadsheet program.
