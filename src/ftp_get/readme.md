# Sample on how to make a FTP Get in php #

Based on the work of Nicolas Talle (@Nicolab) [https://github.com/Nicolab/php-ftp-client](https://github.com/Nicolab/php-ftp-client)

1. Create a new folder in your website (f.i. `ftp`).
2. Create there a folder called `libs` (f.i. `ftp/libs`) and save there a copy of the three files you'll find here, in the libs folder too (these files are coming from [https://github.com/Nicolab/php-ftp-client/tree/master/src/FtpClient](https://github.com/Nicolab/php-ftp-client/tree/master/src/FtpClient)).
3. Download the `ftp_get.php` file from here to your `ftp` folder.
4. Edit the `ftp_get.php` file and update variables with your FTP credentials.  Adjust the folder and filename to download and the local name.
