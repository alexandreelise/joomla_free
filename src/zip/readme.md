# zip

Need a simple script to take an archive of your website.

Just put `zip.php` on your website root folder (or any subfolders) and start the script to get a ZIP file.  

## Use it

Just copy the zip.php script in the folder you want to archive (the root folder or any subfolder f.i.).  Use your FTP client to do this.

## Run it

Start a browser and run the file i.e go to f.i. [http://site/zip.php](http://site/zip.php).

The script will start immediatly, there is nothing to do except wait until the archive is created and output is displayed.

## Remark

Don't forget to remove the script once you've finished with it.

Also note that this script will just "try" to create the archive : there is no mechanism in it to handle f.i. very large website (several hundred megabytes) nor handle CPU timeout (defined by your hosting company).  This script is "a simple one", feel free to suggest improvements.
